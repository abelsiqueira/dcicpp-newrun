 Flag of ALGENCAN: It seems that a stationary-of-the-infeasibility probably
 infeasible point was found. Whether the final iterate is a solution or not
 requires further analysis.

 Additional note: The final point reported by Algencan may be an infeasible
 stationary point of the constraints. Perhaps the problem is infeasible. It
 is also possible that, due to poor scaling and/or inadequate setting of
 the stopping criteria, the final point is satisfactory for your purposes.
 Further analysisis is required.
